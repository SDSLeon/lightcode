 * Pairing from a desktop browser. Pasting the link is the only route here: the
 * desktop showing the code is usually the same screen this page is open on, so
 * pointing a webcam at it is not a real option, and copying the link is a
 * keystroke away. The field is therefore the primary control and is shown
 * outright rather than tucked behind a disclosure — with nothing to demote it in
 * favour of, hiding it would only add a click.
 *
 * Same hero as every other first-launch surface — backdrop, app icon, wordmark —
 * so the layout reads as one product across web, iOS, and Android.
