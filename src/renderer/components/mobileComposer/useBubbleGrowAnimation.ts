 * the real content height (~90px), so a max-height transition between them
 * finishes the visible travel in the first/last ~30ms and the dock reads as
 * snapping.
 *
 * While `expanded` flips, this hook pins an inline height measured from the
 * live layout (height, not max-height: the bubble is content-sized, so only a
 * real height can hold it open against the shrunken collapsed content), lets
 * the CSS transition run between the two px values, then releases back to the
 * stylesheet. Purely presentational: `data-expanded` still flips with the
 * prop, so all inner chrome changes (toolbar, input clamp, border-radius)
 * behave exactly as before. Returns the pin to apply, or null when CSS owns
 * the bubble.
