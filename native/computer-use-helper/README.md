# Poracode computer-use helper

This crate is Poracode's bundled native host for background desktop inspection and control on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It communicates only through newline-delimited JSON on stdin/stdout; diagnostics go to stderr.

## Protocol

Start a persistent host with an optional state directory:

```bash
poracode-computer-use --state-dir /path/to/private/app-state
```

Send one request per line:

```json
{ "id": 1, "action": "hello", "input": { "protocolVersion": 1, "clientVersion": "poracode" } }
```

The response is either `{ "id", "ok": true, "result" }` or `{ "id", "ok": false, "error", "code" }`. Responses may be out of order. `cancel` cooperatively cancels an active request; `shutdown` closes the host. Run `poracode-computer-use --hello` for a one-shot capability/permission handshake or `--version` for the helper version.

Interactive results contain either `delivery` or `refused`. Background failures are structured refusals and never silently fall through to foreground input. Native Wayland coordinate and key input require explicit `mode:"foreground"`; background requests are refused before portal setup or focus changes.

`list_apps` returns running targetable apps by default. Its optional `query` searches installed Start apps on Windows, `.app` bundles on macOS, and `.desktop` entries on Linux; returned ids can be passed directly to `launch_app`.

## Build and checks

The repository pins Rust and the standard `rustfmt` and Clippy components in `rust-toolchain.toml`.

```bash
cargo build --locked
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-features --locked
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps --all-features --locked
cargo deny check
```

From the repository root, `pnpm run prepare:computer-use-helper` builds and stages the current host binary. Release packaging builds Windows x64/arm64, Linux x64-musl, or a macOS x64+arm64 universal binary and validates its `--hello` response.

## Manual QA matrix

For each row, test window discovery, passive capture while partly and fully occluded, `get_window_state(include_text:true)`, element lookup/action/value changes, background click/text/key/scroll/drag, effect verification, explicit foreground takeover, Escape interruption, window recreation, minimized/refused behavior, and permission-denied behavior. Keep another editor focused and type in it during background steps; its focus, pointer, and keystrokes must remain undisturbed.

Linux X11/XWayland routing is covered in CI under `dbus-run-session` and Xvfb. macOS TCC, native Wayland portals, real XWayland compositor behavior, and application compatibility still require hardware/VM runs; cross-compilation alone is not runtime proof.
